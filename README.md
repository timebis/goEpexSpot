![alt text](static/logo400.png)

GoEpexSpot aims to be a comprehensive API client for fetching Day-ahead EPEX SPOT prices using Golang. 

Currently, EPEX SPOT and Nord Pool does not offer a free (or easily accesible) API for non-commercial uses.
However, some stakeholders do provide access. This repository aims to highlight such resources, starting with the French Transmission System Operator (RTE) API for real-time data access.

This repository facilitates price-driven demand response, thereby encouraging environmentally friendly behavior as prices frequently correlate with CO2 marginal emissions.

## Description

GoEpexSpot is designed to unlock the potential of Day-ahead EPEX spot prices for electricity through a unique Go-based API client. In the absence of a freely accessible electricty price API from EPEX SPOT or NordPool for non-commercial purposes, this repository shines a spotlight on alternative sources, beginning with access via the French Transmission System Operator (RTE) API for timely data retrieval. By enabling a price-driven demand response, GoEpexSpot not only facilitates financially smarter energy consumption decisions but also promotes eco-friendly practices as energy price tend to be linked with CO2 emissions.


## Prerequisite

### French Provider

To use this repository, please ensure you meet the following requirements:

- **Account on RTE API Website**: You must have an account to access the RTE API. [Sign up or log in here](https://data.rte-france.com).
- **Subscription to the "Wholesale Market" API**: Access requires a subscription to this specific API. Without it, you will encounter a 403 error. [Subscribe here](https://data.rte-france.com/catalog/-/api/market/Wholesale-Market/v2.0#).

## Usage Example

```go
basicAuthUsername := "YOUR_RTE_API_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME"
basicAuthPassword := "YOUR_RTE_API_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD"

auth := goEpexSpot.AuthOptions{
	Username: basicAuthUsername,
	Password: basicAuthPassword,
}

// Optionally, you can use your independently-fetched bearer token
// bearerToken := os.Getenv("BEARER_TOKEN")
// auth := AuthOptions{
// 	BearerToken: bearerToken,
// }

epexSpotDayAhead, err := goEpexSpot.GetEpexSpot(goEpexSpot.France, auth)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Error while fetching data: %+v\n", err)
} else {
	fmt.Printf("Market Data: %+v\n", epexSpotDayAhead)
}
```
